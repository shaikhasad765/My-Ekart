# My-EKart Online Shopping (API Project)
This is an online shopping web application built using React, React Hooks, Redux, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app provides features such as Firebase authentication, a basic landing page, a shop page displaying products fetched from api, a products page with product details, a cart page for managing items.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features
Add new Product
Edit or Delete existing and new products
Add products to cart
Sort product by price
view Product Details

## Installation
To run the application locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:

2. Install dependencies:
  npm install
3. Create a Firebase project and set up the necessary configurations. You can find instructions on how to set up Firebase here.
4. Start the development server:
  npm start

The application will be running at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage
  --Visit the shop page to browse the available products.
  --Click on edit to edit the product details
  --Visit the cart page to manage your cart items and proceed to checkout.
  --On the checkout page, you can review your order and place it.

## Technologies

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
